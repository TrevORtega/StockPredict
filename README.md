# StockPredict
A Stock Market Predictor web application in the C# ASP.NET MVC framework. It uses dynamic graphs to display all market predictions based on an original formula.

Essentially, using the formula created from my stock-predict repository, this web applicaiton shows the entire history of the Dow Jones and displays stock market predictions for the price of the market at any given date in recorded history. It also gives trading tips on whether or not to buy or sell based on market trends.
